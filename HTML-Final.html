        <h2> <u> About Misty Copeland: </u> </h2>
        <p> Misty Danielle Copeland (born September 10, 1982 is an American ballet dancer for <a href="https://www.abt.org/"> American Ballet Theatre (ABT) </a>, one of the three leading classical ballet companies in the United States. On June 30, 2015, Copeland became the first African American woman to be promoted to principal dancer in ABT's 75-year history. </p>

        <p> Copeland was considered a prodigy who rose to stardom despite not starting ballet until the age of 13. Two years later, in 1998, her ballet teachers, who were serving as her custodial guardians, and her mother, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, <a href="https://mistycopeland.com/"> Copeland </a>, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. </p>
